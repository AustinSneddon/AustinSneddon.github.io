<h1>Mildly Amusing</h1>

    The internet is a great place for lots of different resources from education to entertainment. It is always a great place <br>
    to get a laugh. This page has a few things that make me laugh.
</h4>
<h2><strong><u>Top Laugh</u></strong></h2>
<p>
    I find a lot of my humor in youtube videos. Because everyone' sense of humor is completely different I won't like to <br>
    specific video, but if you go here I'm sure you are going to find something you find entertianing.

<h2><strong><u>Fresh Laughs</u></strong></h2>
<p>
   To be a little different than what you answere. I also enjoy reddit sometimes for a few jokes. One of the pages that I <br>
   is "Dad Jokes". They're always fairly bad, but that's what makes them so entertianing.

<h2><strong><u>Old Laughs</u></strong></h2>
<p>
   For me the laughs are older, but they aren't old. They more lean to the side of nostalgia. Vines are something that were <br>
   really popular when I started high-school and then went away almost as quickly as they came. In that short time there were<br>
   a lot of great things that came out of it. Here's a compilation of some of those.
