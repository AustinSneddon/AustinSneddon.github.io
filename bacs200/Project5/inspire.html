        As someone interested in the film industry I am greatly inspired by <br>
	Denis Villeneuve. I find his interest in making films he know wont be <br>
	wildly popular, but still decidedes to make them endearing. I also do <br>
	love them films he does end up making.
    </p>
    <p>
        Denis Villeneuve has a few charecteristics that inspsire me most.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li> Persistance in making something to a great quality. </li>
	<li> Recognizing something didn't do well [financially], but being okay with it. </li>
	<li> Ability to create something beautfiully made. </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Denis Villeneuve is an udoubtable force in the film industry today. He isn't making moveis <br>
	that are pretentious (for the most part), but movies that are accessable for everyone. He <br>
	has a great desire to get people in movie theaters and to enjoy the art that him and many <br>
	others create.
