					<h2>Social Implications</h2>
					<p>
                        With a lot of discourse in society as of now; gaps between people's beliefs there are unprecidented issues that have not been before seen. Recently in Canada there <br>
                        has been a big push for the stopping of Covid restrictions upon the people. In response to this Canada didn't allow people who monetarily supported the group against <br>
                        Covid restrictions to be able to access their bank accounts. This creates a scary time when the govermnet is able to seize control over people's wellbeing in such a large <br>
                        fashion. With Crypto[currecny] people are free from govermnet restrictions. There isn't one power that can control the markets are shut down people monetarily. This does <br>
                        raise issues with terrorist orginizations being able to trade money freely, but this will always be a present issue within any kind of system.

					<h2>Economical Implications</h2>
					<p>
                        Economically there isn'y much different in terms of taxation with the united states. Crypto is still taxed as income, but the biggest issue is the way the prices fluxuate.<br>
                        It is as if the currency is a stock. This can cause people to gain or lose money in large chunks at a time. One week, the most popular Crypto, Bitcoin could be at $60,000 <br>
                        and the next it could be down to $30,000. This is the biggest issue. Even with the extreme inflation we are seeing now doesn't have these huge swings in price. The American<br>
                        dollar is fairly stable especially when compared to other currencies and Crypto.

					<h2>Political Implications</h2>
					<p>
                        There have been many talks recently about regulating Cryptocurrency. This is due in part to that the money that is in Crypto is not held in the hands of the government.<br>
                        If you were to run a business off of Cryptocurrency it would be easier to commit tax evasion as the transfer of Crypto doesn't have to go through an medium. You can send<br>
                        the money directly to another person without the need for, like normal currecny, a bank or intermediary.

					<h2>Conclusion</h2>
					<p>
                        Cryptocurrency is fairly risk as of now as there are still fluctuations within the market that make it seem more like a volatile stock than a currency. However not being<br>
                        suseptable to the government being able to shut down any of your bank accounts. You should still be wary of Cryptocurrency, but be prepared for it to be useful.
